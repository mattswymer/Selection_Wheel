Selection Wheel
===============

A sleek, modern, and feature-rich interactive spinning wheel built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool is perfect for randomly selecting an item from a list, such as a student for a question, a prize winner, or a random task to work on.

The application is designed with a polished, dark-mode UI and is fully responsive for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
--------

-   **Smart Text Input**: Paste lists in various formats (e.g., `Last, First`, `First Last`, separated by newlines, commas, tabs, or semicolons). The app intelligently parses and formats the names.

-   **Customizable Spin Physics**: Choose between different "feel" presets (`Calm`, `Classic`, `Snappy`) to control the wheel's spinning behavior.

-   **Charge-Up Mechanic**: Press and hold the spin button to "charge" the wheel for a faster, more powerful spin.

-   **No Repeats Option**: Automatically remove an entry once it has been selected to ensure fairness and prevent duplicates.

-   **Undo Functionality**: Accidentally removed an entry? Easily undo the last removal.

-   **Advanced Customization**: Fine-tune the experience with options like large labels, label rotation, auto-capitalization, and more.

-   **Result History**: Keep track of the most recent and all previous selections.

-   **Confetti Celebration**: A fun confetti burst celebrates the winning selection.

-   **Local Storage Persistence**: Your list of entries is automatically saved in your browser, so it's there when you come back.

How to Use
----------

1.  **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser.

2.  **Add Entries**: Type or paste your list of names or items into the "Entries" text area on the right.

3.  **Apply Changes**: Click the "Apply" button to load the entries onto the wheel.

4.  **Spin**: Press and hold the central "SPIN" button. The longer you hold, the more power you build up. Release the button to spin the wheel.

5.  **View Results**: The selected item will be displayed prominently, and a history of previous selections will be kept.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the application.

-   **CSS3**: For all styling, layout, and animations. It uses modern features like CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for easy theming.

-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all application logic, including the rendering of the wheel on an HTML Canvas, physics calculations, and user interactions. The code is self-contained in a single file and has no external dependencies.
